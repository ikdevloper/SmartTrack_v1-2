SmartTrack v1.2: Update Summary
Version 1.2 of the SmartTrack expense & goal tracker introduces important reliability, automation, and visual improvements to deliver a better and bug-free experience.

What's Updated in SmartTrack v1.2
1. Goal Progress Calculation Fixes
Automatic goal progress update whenever you add, edit, or delete transactions, or change a goal.

Goal values recalculate immediately, reflecting your actual savings and spending without delay.

Savings Goals: Current progress now updates as (Total Income - Total Expenses).

Budget/Event Goals: Progress updates as (Total Expenses).

2. Bug Fixes & Robust Data Handling
All UI and data-changing actions (add, edit, delete, sync) now trigger goal progress recalculation, chart refresh, and stat updatesâ€”so all visuals instantly match your data.

Fixed filter tab errors caused by missing event parameters. Tabs work reliably to switch views.

Handling of empty charts/data states improved to avoid errors or blank screens.

3. Animated Charts and Data Visualization
Integrated Chart.js for animated charts:

Expense Distribution Chart: Doughnut chart with animated fills and tooltips shows expense breakdown by category.

Income vs Expenses Chart: Animated bar chart for a clear comparison.

Charts auto-refresh on every transaction/goal change for accurate visuals.

4. Smoother UI Animations
Progress bars for goals animate smoothly.

Statistical card numbers animate on update.

Transaction entries animate on add/delete for better UX.

5. Footer & Version Badge
Added a visible footer label to easily recognize the new build:

SmartTrack v1.2 - Build: 2025-10-22

6. Cleaner Code & Layout
Streamlined CSS and code structure for easier future upgrades.

All essential UI elements (forms, stats, goals, transactions, charts) are present and organized.

How to Use v1.2
Open the HTML file in your browser.

Add transactions and goals as usual.

Switch filter tabs for custom views.

Enjoy full automatic progress tracking and animated analytics!
